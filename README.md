# Distributed-Training-of-SVM-using-ADMM-Optimization-Algorithm
Highly scalable SVM(Support Vector Machine) model which can be trained in a distributed way, by splitting the data into more than one clusters. Each of the data clusters can be trained independently in different machines and the intermediate results can be combined in a central node, using ADMM (Alternating direction method of multipliers) optimization algorithm. This model can work with extremely huge amounts of data and build a SVM classifier very faster by exploiting the power of distributed computing.
